## Review Section

### Summary of Changes Made
1. **Documentation Foundation**: Created three core documentation files (README.MD, PLANNING.MD, TODO.MD) that establish the project structure and development roadmap
2. **Technology Stack Decision**: Chose React Native for cross-platform development based on developer availability and ecosystem strength
3. **Architecture Planning**: Designed a clean separation between Python backend services and React Native frontend with clear component responsibilities
4. **Development Phases**: Organized work into 5 logical phases spanning 10 weeks with clear goals and deliverables

### Key Decisions Made
- **Framework Choice**: React Native selected over Flutter and Capacitor for better developer availability and ecosystem
- **Backend Architecture**: FastAPI with service-oriented design for scalability and maintainability
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive unit and integration testing with >80% coverage target
- **Deployment Strategy**: Multi-platform deployment via Expo Application Services

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation starting with backend FastAPI setup
2. Set up development environment with virtual environment and dependencies
3. Create initial project structure following the planned architecture
4. Implement basic Pydantic schema parsing functionality

### Potential Risks & Mitigation
- **OpenAI API Costs**: Implement request caching and rate limiting
- **Complex UI Generation**: Start with simple field types and gradually add complexity
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Use React Native best practices and test on multiple platforms early
- **Schema Complexity**: Handle edge cases incrementally with comprehensive testing
